During my years pursuing a career in STEM I have faced challenges looking for funding opportunities to get my academic degrees, participate in scientific events among others. I want to summarize the scholarships and awards that I have encountered as an information resource. I hope this is useful for people who are looking to improve their professional profile, specially if they come from a disadvantageous background.
