I have been passionate about science and learning all my life. During my early years at college, I finished two BSc degrees, one in Biology at the University of Antioquia and a second one in Biological Engineering at the National University of Colombia. This experience gave me the opportunity to learn basic research in biology and the application of math models and engineering systems in industry. I conducted research modeling drug targets for leishmaniasis and creating molecular characterizations of clinical isolates of *Fusarium*. It was during this time that I developed my passion for data science. 

After this, I completed my MSc in Biomedical Research at University of Valladolid in Spain thanks to a Santander scholarship. There I worked in a research project evaluating the splicing effects of BRCA2 variants in hereditarian breast and ovarian cancer. This experience gave me the opportunity to expand my knowledge in human genomics and molecular techniques in biomedical sciences. My success in my masterâ€™s degree opened opportunities to continue with my Ph.D. with the Fulbright and Schlumberger fellowships.

I then moved to the U.S. to earn my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, where I joined [Wise lab](https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/rpwise/) and graduated with a perfect 4.0 GPA and was awarded multiple recognitions for excellence in research. My Ph.D. research proposed mathematical models to analyze proteomics and transcriptomics datasets applied to unraveling plant disease resistance mechanisms. I integrated systems biology and statistical modeling approaches with multi-omics data to characterize the defense of barley to the powdery mildew disease. I developed a novel method for computationally prioritizing protein-protein interactions from next generation yeast-two hybrid data, called [Y2H-SCORES](https://github.com/vvelasqz/Y2H-SCORES), and created a workflow to automate the analysis in R. These projects contribute to the understanding of mechanisms that control plant immunity and will benefit sustainable agriculture and cereal breeding programs.

I have also been involved in several extension and outreach programs, as I am aware of the importance of the transfer of scientific knowledge to the community. I have participated in the [Master-gardener](https://www.extension.iastate.edu/mastergardener/) outreach program hosted by the Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology, and I have also volunteered in different programming workshops to instruct graduate students at ISU. I was also the director of outreach of the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Graduate Student Organization, which impact hundreds of girls and young women every year. In these, we design activities to encourage girls to pursue STEM fields by participating in outreach programs like Go further, Science Bound and Girls in Science. 

Working with others has been core to my success as a scientist. I have been able to work with collaborators from the U.K., Australia, Denmark, South Africa, Spain, Colombia and published with several groups worldwide. I have learned to appreciate the different perspectives and approaches of various cultures and the diversity they offer to conducting science.

I am looking forward to collaborations and opportunities where I can find fulfillment in my work by continuing to expand my understanding of biological systems and apply my data analysis expertise
