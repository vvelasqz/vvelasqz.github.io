## Y2H-SCORES
[Y2H-SCORES](https://github.com/vvelasqz/Y2H-SCORES) is a software developed to rank protein-protein interactions from yeast two-hybrid next generation interaction screening (Y2H-NGIS) data. Besides the software, I developed a [Y2H-NGIS simulator](https://github.com/vvelasqz/Y2H-SCORES/tree/master/Publication/Y2H-NGIS_simulator) to generate Y2H-NGIS data, and a [Benchmarking](https://github.com/vvelasqz/Y2H-SCORES/tree/master/Publication/Benchmarking) section that proves the performance of the software across published datasets.

I extended Y2H-SCORES to work with mass spectomertry Co-IP data, as you can see [here](https://github.com/vvelasqz/BC1)

##Interact-omics
I developed [Interact-omics](https://github.com/vvelasqz/Barley_Interactome), a series of workflows to integrate interactome data with other omics like eQTL, RNASeq and Y2H-NGIS. Different network analyses are presented and applied to characterize the signaling of the *Mla* receptor. 

## TranscriptoNET
I am developing different data analysis workflows for transcriptome data. [TranscriptoNET](https://github.com/vvelasqz/TranscriptoNET) include generation and integration of Gene Ragulatory Networks (GRNs), prioritization of transcription factors for their role in regulating expression, data visualization and epistatic analysis of gene effects on gene expression.
